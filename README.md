## Phase 2 – Backend Implementation

The backend of this project was developed using Node.js and Express.
It provides user authentication functionality and is connected to a MySQL
database using XAMPP.

### Implemented Features
- RESTful API built with Express
- MySQL database integration
- User registration with password hashing (bcrypt)
- User login with credential validation
- Persistent data storage
- API tested using HTTP requests

### Backend Architecture
The backend follows a modular structure with separate files for:
- Routes
- Controllers
- Database configuration

The frontend communicates with the backend using HTTP requests to perform
authentication operations.
